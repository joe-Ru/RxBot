- After some careful debugging I found what was causing the previous errors:
    -Simply put, native javascript does not work well with 'import' and 'export' syntax. For 
    whatever reason, I have no freaking clue. Thats why in the previous log I had to remove the 
    listed lines and replace them as 'import...from....' however that was only due in part because I placed
    the "type" : "module" line in the package.json thereby requiring everything to act like a module. 
    -So it was either add that simple line > rewrite the contant variables > and deal with more errors. OR 
    -Remove the [import { DISCORD_TOKEN} from './token.js'] and find a different way to store the token.
    -I chose neither and instead installed the [esm] module (this was after installing babel, and a plethora of other node
     modules), so now in order to run it you must type [node -r esm .\RxBot.js. Hopefully this won't bring about more bugs.

-In conclusion: Debugging is done, cat fact and cat pics work, now its time to get the medFact command to work. I can now
utilize the import functionally as I build this thing.

-Removed the following lines:

const axios = require('axios');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const { Client, RichEmbed } = require('discord.js');

-As it does not work so far. Instead placing statements such as "import fetch from 'node-fetch'" seems to work.

## 12/27/2019 ##
-Installed node fetch module in order to speak with APIs requests a lot easier.
-package.json created (finally)
-Cat fact command working.

## 12/26/2019 ##
-Stopped using python, will use Javascript going forward
-Have posting cat picture on command to the desired channel

## 12/15/2019 ##
-Used code in order to try and post cat picture.
-Added config.py and actions.py in order to store other features
-Will probably end up deleting config.py

## 12/14/2019 ##
-Added command to clear out messages
-Can now delete messages sent using await 'ctx.channel.purge(limit=1)'
-8ball command takes input from user and can now delete user input.
-Installed requests package through pip

## 12/13/2019 ##
-Stopped using Anaconda as a way to build the application, much easier to install pip and download the discord.py
through there
-Stopped using PyCharm, this allows for the program to do what it is intended with less extra steps, also a lot easier for others
to use.
